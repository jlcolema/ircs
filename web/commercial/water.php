			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>Commercial water losses can happen at any time and can range in size from a corner office being wet to all flooding on every floor. When these losses occur, the water will travel in all directions, soaking some areas while leaving minimal damage to others. Commercial property owners want the problem fixed when the incident occurs, even if it is after business hours. Indiana Restorations and Cleaning Services is ready to go to work 24 hours a day. We understand how important it is to have your business back up and running in as little time as possible.</p>

			<h3>Services</h3>

			<p class="note"><i>Indiana Restoration &amp; Cleaning Services follows standards for water damage restoration as set forth by the Institute for Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification&rsquo;s (IICRC) S-500 Water Damage Mitigation Standard.</i></p>

			<dl>

				<dt>Extraction</dt>
				<dd>The first step in correcting a water damage loss is to identify what is wet. We use a variety of moisture meters to identify elevated moisture levels in building materials. The second step is to remove as much physical water as possible. We use high powered portable units to reach the top floors and environmentally-friendly diesel powered units to remove water from the lower levels.</dd>
				
				<dt>Drying</dt>
				<dd>The drying process can take anywhere from 24 hours to several days to dry the materials affected by water. Our main priority is communication with you, our client, so that we can have your business back running as soon as possible. We will inspect the drying process to keep you informed of the progress along the way.</dd>
				
				<dt>Humidity Control</dt>
				<dd>Each building that gets wet provides a set of unique challenges to the company asked to fix the problem. We will dry the building using the best method for the circumstances. We understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach in the restoration business. Managing the removal of unnecessary moisture from the structure will be documented daily &ndash; if not hourly. We have all the necessary equipment and knowledge to handle any size loss. We understand your priorities and get you back in business &ndash; that is our promise to you.</dd>
