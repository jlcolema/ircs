After it has been fully cleaned and deodorized it is safely stored at our facility where it awaits delivery back to your home following successful repairs and restoration.</dd>

				<dt>Structural Drying</dt>
				<dd>Unfortunately, the act of extinguishing a fire usually dictates that safety professionals employ a significant amount of water that stays in the home. If not addressed, the water used to extinguish the fire can add to the damage caused by the fire or smoke. Indiana Restoration and Cleaning Services will partner with you to make sure all facets of the restoration process are looked after. Read more about water damage services</dd>
